This directory contains the binary .R files created by the HP 10391B inverse
assembler development package from the .S files in the src directory.

These files are included here for convenience.

The .R files are created and transfered to your logic analyzer using the .BAT
files in the src directory.  The .BAT files use the "ialdown" DOS program
included in the HP 10391B package to do the transfer.  Alternative methods
for transferring .R files to the logic analyzer are described in the .S files.
