This directory contains the final I8031 and I80C310 binary inverse assembler
files used by the logic analyzer, as well as the intermediate I8031.R and I80C310.R
files created by the HP 10391B inverse assembler development package from the
I8031.S and I80C310.S files in the src directory.

These files are included here for convenience.

To use the inverse assembler without recompiling from the source .S files, simply
copy the I8031 or I80C310 files to the logic analyzer via ftp if the logic analyzer
has a network connection, or via floppy disk.
